# **Project Title**: Predicting and Analyzing AMCAT Test Scores

## **Goals**:
- To evaluate candidates' performance in the AMCAT test.
- To explore how the different sections of the exam (such as English, Quantitative Ability, Logical Reasoning) affect the total score.
- To create a machine learning model that predicts test outcomes based on past performance data.

## **Libraries and Tools**:
- **Pandas**: Used for organizing, filtering, and cleaning the dataset.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for performing numerical operations and handling large arrays.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed to create visualizations and display score distributions.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used to design and evaluate machine learning models (both regression and classification).
- **Statsmodels**: For conducting statistical analysis and testing hypotheses.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as an interactive platform for coding, visualization, and documentation.

## **Visualization Techniques**:
- **Histograms & KDE**: Used to show how scores in various sections (like English or Quantitative) are distributed.
- **Boxplots**: Helped identify data outliers and assess score variations across sections.
- **Pairplots**: Enabled visual exploration of relationships between different test sections to find correlations.
- **Heatmaps**: Illustrated the correlation matrix, showcasing how different sections impact the overall performance.
- **Bar Charts**: Depicted average scores for different candidate groups, categorized by demographics such as education or work experience.

## **Steps in Analysis**:

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
- Examined score patterns across different sections to identify missing data, outliers, and trends.
  
### **Correlation Analysis**:
- Investigated how individual test sections relate to the overall score.
- Used heatmaps to visualize which sections have the strongest or weakest correlations.


## **Conclusions**:
- Sections like Logical Reasoning and Quantitative Ability were found to have a strong influence on the overall AMCAT score.
- The machine learning model successfully predicted total scores with a high level of accuracy, based on performance in individual sections.
- These findings provide actionable insights for students, guiding them on which sections to prioritize for higher test scores.
- Focusing on weaker sections showed significant potential to boost overall test performance, benefiting students' employability prospects.
